Automating AI Workflows with Crew AI & Gemini!

I just built an AI-driven workflow using Crew AI, LiteLLM, and Gemini 1.5 Flash! This project automates a step-by-step process to:

Generate a random Asian country
Pick a city from that country
Discover a fun fact about the city
Save the results in a file automatically

Using Crew AI's decorators (@start, @listen), I made the workflow completely autonomous! This is just the beginningâ€”next, Iâ€™ll explore more complex AI agents. ðŸš€
